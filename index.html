							<h1>Fund Julia</h1>
							<p class="major">Dear friends. As you may know Julia Kuntz has finished 3 years of IHOPU and is going for her 4th! As part of her curriculum she decided to go teach in Crescendo for the summer instead of working and earning money for her tuition.</p>
							<p>Because of this choice there is still missing a few thousand dollars before she can start school! She has to have all the money in August, or else she even can't get a visa and go back to the U.S. This site is here for raising funds and getting her into her last year.</p>
							<ul class="actions stacked">
								<li><a href="#first" class="button big wide smooth-scroll-middle">Check how you can help!</a></li>

							<h2>Give funds through Sebastiaan and Jolanda</h2>
							<p>Up until the 5th of august (end of Crescendo) Sebastiaan and Jolanda will collect funds raised for Julia. The most easy way of giving is just handing the money to them and they will transfer all of it to Julia. Contact Sebastiaan for bank details. He can even send you a (Dutch) tikkie.</p>

							<h2>Thank you so much</h2>
							<p>Julia is really investing a lot in Crescendo this summer and is very humble in asking anything in return. This fundraiser is also not her own idea but a gift. Thank you so much for taking the time to check this out and give!</p>
